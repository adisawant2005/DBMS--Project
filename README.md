# My-SecondYear-Project
Iâ€™m thrilled to present my second-year mini projectâ€”a comprehensive E-Book Store! ðŸ“š

This project was built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), providing a robust and scalable foundation. I also integrated a variety of JavaScript libraries, including Tailwind CSS for sleek styling, react-router and react-router-dom for smooth navigation, react-icons for visual enhancement, React-Redux and @reduxjs/toolkit for efficient state management, axios for handling HTTP requests, dotenv for managing environment variables, nanoid for unique IDs, cors for managing cross-origin resource sharing, multer for file uploads, and pg for database interactions.

This project was a fantastic opportunity to apply and expand my full-stack development skills. Iâ€™m excited to share it with you all!
